# SMILES-RNN
The code is the basis of our submission (Neural network prediction model for dew point and bubble point phase equilibria behavior of binary mixtures in alcohol systems ) and is designed to utilize SMILES and thermodynamic properties to train recurrent neural networks to predict vapor-liquid equilibrium data.
